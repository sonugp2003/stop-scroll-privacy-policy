        <h1>Privacy Policy for Unscroll</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 27, 2025</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Quick Summary:</strong> Unscroll helps you stay focused by automatically detecting and blocking short-form video content (YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok, Facebook Reels, Snapchat Spotlight, Twitter/X videos). <strong>We collect and share personal information</strong> including your Advertising ID, device information, and approximate location (inferred from IP address) with Google AdMob for advertising purposes. Crash diagnostics and basic analytics are <strong>disabled by default</strong> and collected only if you <strong>explicitly opt in</strong> in-app. All blocking statistics and preferences stay on your device and are never transmitted.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>We Collect Personal Information</strong>
            <p>Unscroll collects and shares certain personal information as defined by privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, VCDPA, etc.). Personal information includes any data that can be used to identify you or your device, either alone or in combination with other information.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Unscroll integrates <strong>Google AdMob</strong> for ads and optional <strong>Firebase</strong> services. Data collection is limited and compliant with Google policies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Advertising data (via Google AdMob)</strong>: Advertising ID, approximate location inferred from IP, device information (model, OS version, screen size), ad interaction data (views, clicks) — used to serve and measure ads.</li>
            <li><strong>Crash diagnostics (via Firebase Crashlytics)</strong>: Stack traces and device state at time of crash — <em>disabled by default</em>; only collected if you <strong>opt in</strong> in settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Basic analytics (via Firebase Analytics)</strong>: Event telemetry about feature usage — <em>disabled by default</em>; only collected if you <strong>opt in</strong> in settings.</li>
            <li><strong>FCM token</strong>: A messaging token used to receive notifications — stored <em>locally</em> on your device.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Personal Information Collected and Transmitted:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>✓ Advertising ID</strong> - A unique identifier assigned to your device by Google, collected and transmitted to Google AdMob for advertising purposes</li>
            <li><strong>✓ Device Information</strong> - Device model, manufacturer, operating system version, screen size, language settings - collected and transmitted to Google AdMob</li>
            <li><strong>✓ Approximate Location</strong> - Country/city level location inferred from your IP address by Google AdMob (we do not directly collect or access your IP address or location)</li>
            <li><strong>✓ Ad Interaction Data</strong> - Information about ads you view or click - collected and transmitted to Google AdMob</li>
            <li><strong>✓ App Usage Data</strong> - Which features you use within Unscroll - collected and transmitted to Firebase ONLY if you opt in</li>
            <li><strong>✓ Crash Data</strong> - Technical diagnostic information when the app crashes - collected and transmitted to Firebase ONLY if you opt in</li>
            <li><strong>✓ Purchase Information</strong> - Records of in-app purchases - transmitted to Google Play Billing for payment processing</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>When Personal Information is Transmitted:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AdMob data</strong> - Transmitted automatically when ads are loaded or displayed (required for free app functionality)</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase data</strong> - Transmitted only if you explicitly enable crash reports or analytics in Settings</li>
            <li><strong>Purchase data</strong> - Transmitted only when you make an in-app purchase</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>We do NOT collect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>❌ Precise location data (GPS coordinates) - only approximate location is inferred by AdMob from IP</li>
            <li>❌ Device identifiers beyond Advertising ID (no IMEI, Android ID, Serial Number)</li>
            <li>❌ Personal identifiable information (name, email, phone number, address)</li>
            <li>❌ Browsing history or app content outside Unscroll's targeted UI checks</li>
            <li>❌ Contact information or address book</li>
            <li>❌ Camera, microphone, photos, or media files</li>
            <li>❌ Passwords or credentials</li>
            <li>❌ Messages, SMS, or call logs</li>
            <li>❌ Financial information (payment details are handled securely by Google Play)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Important Disclosure:</strong> While we don't directly collect some of this data (like IP address or precise device identifiers), Google AdMob may collect additional information through their SDK as described in their privacy policy. We have integrated AdMob in a way that minimizes data collection, but you should review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a> for complete details on their data practices.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Stored Locally</h2>
        <p>The following data is stored <strong>only on your device</strong> and is <strong>never transmitted to our servers</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blocking statistics</strong> - Count of how many times short-form content was blocked per app</li>
            <li><strong>App preferences</strong> - Which apps you want to block (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter)</li>
            <li><strong>Settings</strong> - Schedule preferences, theme selection, temporary pause state</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Note: We have no backend servers; your data remains on-device.</em></p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>Information collected is used for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ad personalization</strong> - Google AdMob uses data to show relevant ads (subject to UMP consent and device ad settings)</li>
            <li><strong>App functionality</strong> - To remember your settings and track your progress</li>
            <li><strong>App improvement</strong> - Crash reports and analytics are <em>opt-in</em> and help fix bugs and improve UX</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3.1. Firebase Analytics & Crashlytics Opt-In Policy</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Important: User Consent Required</strong>
            <p>Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics are <strong>DISABLED by default</strong> when you first install Unscroll. These services will <strong>ONLY</strong> collect data if you <strong>explicitly enable them</strong> in the app's Settings menu.</p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>How to Enable/Disable (Your Choice):</strong></p>

            <li>Toggle <strong>"Help improve Unscroll with anonymous usage analytics"</strong> (Firebase Analytics)</li>
            <li>You can enable/disable these at any time</li>
            <li>No data is collected unless you turn these ON</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What happens if you opt in:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics (if enabled)</strong>: Collects crash stack traces, device model, OS version, and app state at crash time to help us fix bugs. No personal information is collected.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Analytics (if enabled)</strong>: Collects anonymous event telemetry (e.g., "user opened settings", "user paused blocking") to understand which features are used. No personal information is collected.</li>
            <li><strong>Your data remains anonymous</strong>: Firebase does not link crash/analytics data to your identity</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What happens if you opt out (default):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ No crash reports sent to our servers</li>
            <li>✅ No analytics data collected</li>
            <li>✅ All app functionality works normally</li>

        </div>
        
        <p><strong>What you can request access to:</strong></p>

                <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    <li>Your Advertising ID (found in Settings → Google → Ads on your device)</li>

                    <li>Specific information you want to access (or "all available data")</li>
                    <li>Preferred format for receiving data (PDF, JSON, or text)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

Local data includes blocking statistics, app preferences, and settings. For data collected by third-party services (AdMob, Firebase if opted in), we will coordinate with those providers to fulfill your access request.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>You have the right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal data and targeted advertising.</strong>
            <p>While Unscroll does not sell your personal information for money, some state privacy laws (CCPA, VCDPA, UCPA, CPA, CTDPA) define "sale" or "sharing" broadly to include data sharing for targeted advertising purposes.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>What you can opt-out of:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Targeted/Personalized Advertising</strong> - Ads based on your behavior across apps and websites</li>
            <li><strong>Data sharing with advertising partners</strong> - Sharing your Advertising ID with Google AdMob for ad personalization</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-context behavioral advertising</strong> - Ads based on your activity across different contexts</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>How to opt-out (multiple methods available):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Method 1 - Device Settings (Recommended):</strong>
                <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    <li>Go to <strong>Settings → Google → Ads</strong></li>
                    <li>Toggle ON <strong>"Opt out of Ads Personalization"</strong></li>
                    <li>This stops all personalized ads across all apps on your device</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Method 2 - Reset Advertising ID:</strong>
                <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    <li>Go to <strong>Settings → Google → Ads</strong></li>
                    <li>Tap <strong>"Reset advertising ID"</strong></li>
                    <li>This gives you a fresh advertising ID, breaking past ad targeting</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Method 3 - Delete Advertising ID (Android 12+):</strong>
                <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    <li>Go to <strong>Settings → Privacy → Ads</strong></li>
                    <li>Tap <strong>"Delete advertising ID"</strong></li>
                    <li>This removes your advertising ID entirely (you'll still see ads, but they won't be personalized)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Method 4 - Email Request:</strong>
                <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    <li>Send an email to <a href="mailto:un0scroll@gmail.com">un0scroll@gmail.com</a></li>
                    <li>Subject line: <strong>"Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information"</strong></li>
                    <li>Include your Advertising ID and device information</li>
                    <li>We will process your request within 15 business days</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Effect of opting out:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ You will still see ads (required to support the free app), but they will be generic/contextual instead of personalized</li>
            <li>✅ Your Advertising ID will not be used for targeted advertising</li>
            <li>✅ Your data will not be shared with advertising partners for personalization</li>
            <li>✅ All app features continue to work normally</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Unscroll requests the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accessibility Service</strong> - Required to detect short-form video content in 6 specific apps (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter/X) by reading UI labels and button text for pattern matching, then automatically navigating away. All data is analyzed locally in real-time and immediately discarded. This permission monitors ONLY these 6 apps and does NOT record screen content, read passwords/messages, or track activity outside targeted apps.</li>
            <li><strong>Receive Boot Completed</strong> - Allows the app to restart the accessibility service after device reboot (if you had it enabled)</li>
            <li><strong>Internet</strong> - Required to load advertisements from Google AdMob</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications</strong> - Used to deliver reminders and alerts (Android 13+ prompts at runtime)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Unscroll does NOT request or use location, camera, microphone, contacts, SMS, phone, or biometric permissions.</p>

        <h2>11. Accessibility Service Transparency</h2>
        <p>Unscroll uses Android's <strong>AccessibilityService API</strong> solely for content blocking. Here's exactly what it does:</p>
        
        <h3 style="color: #1e40af; font-size: 1.1em; margin-top: 20px;">What It Monitors:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Only these 6 apps: YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter/X</li>
            <li>Reads UI labels and button text to detect short-form video screens (Shorts, Reels, etc.)</li>
            <li>Analyzes data locally in real-time for pattern matching, then immediately discards it</li>
            <li>No monitoring outside these 6 apps</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 style="color: #1e40af; font-size: 1.1em; margin-top: 20px;">What It Does:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When short-form content is detected, automatically presses the back button or navigates to home screen</li>
            <li>Updates local blocking statistics (stored only on your device)</li>
            <li>Nothing else - no recording, no data collection, no transmission</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 style="color: #1e40af; font-size: 1.1em; margin-top: 20px;">What It Does NOT Do:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>❌ Does NOT record or capture screen content</li>
            <li>❌ Does NOT read passwords, messages, or user-entered personal content</li>
            <li>❌ Does NOT store or transmit any data to external servers</li>
            <li>❌ Does NOT track your activity outside the 6 targeted apps</li>
            <li>❌ Does NOT access clipboard, keyboard input, or other apps</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>You are in control:</strong> You can disable the accessibility service anytime in Android Settings → Accessibility → Unscroll → Toggle OFF.</p>
